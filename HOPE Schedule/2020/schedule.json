Advanced understanding is presented of how humans' conscious mind critical factor works, and can be exploited in targeted social engineering. The critical factor is a part of the conscious mind that responds to demands on a person, and regulates compliance versus noncompliance. Social influence, manipulation, or obfuscation of the attacker's intent or motives have traditionally been used in psychological operations, like social engineering. Tailoring communication patterns specific to a person's conscious vulnerabilities inherent in their critical factor increases desired response compliance, as subconscious processes regulating suggestibility are accessed. Identifying a person's specific conscious mind critical factor suggestibility, adapting communication to exploit psychological vulnerabilities, and entraining a desired state of consciousness depth are used in a targeted attack to obtain a desired behavioral, psychological, emotional, or physiological effect. Attendees will learn advanced psychological techniques to improve their own social security and recognize suggestibility exploits in human targets.<br><br>", "description": "", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 134, "code": "FATH8M", "public_name": "Josh \"Peon\" Patrick Paulton", "biography": "**Josh \"Peon\" Patrick Paulton** (joshhealthcare.com) is a registered clinical counselor with the British Columbia Association of Clinical Counselors in Canada.

Furthermore, significant defenses such as the recent Spectre mitigations often require compiler-level changes. Even for open source systems, it takes time to rebuild projects from source and incorporate a modified compiler.<br><br>One simple way to transform a binary is to emulate or virtualize its execution environment. Existing tools (DynamoRIO, Pin, Valgrind) that perform such dynamic binary translation will be introduced. These tools work on nearly any binary and can be extremely useful, although they necessarily introduce some overhead. Other than virtualization, another popular technique is binary rewriting, which is useful for introducing small changes (especially patches), but requires quite a thorough understanding of the binary at hand.<br><br>The main part of the talk will introduce a new tool called Egalito, which works differently than existing tools. In the past, binary analysis has been seen as intractable: it quite easily reduces to the halting problem. However, modern binaries have substantial metadata embedded in them. In particular, most Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch, etc.) have moved to position-independent executables by default. Egalito shows that such binaries can be completely and precisely analyzed, with all cross-references resolved; after which, user modifications can be introduced; after which, a new binary can be created with no constraints from the original binary. This process is called binary recompilation: it introduces no overhead from virtualization or trampoline jumps.<br><br>The goal is to allow Linux power users to transform any binary on their system at a moment's notice, and to improve performance or security. This talk will convince developers and users that binary transformation is a useful tool for any developer's toolbox.<br><br>", "description": "", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 220, "code": "N83QTP", "public_name": "David Williams-King", "biography": "**David Williams-King** is finishing his PhD in binary security at Columbia University.

Digital stalking is a huge and fast growing problem. Android stalkerware apps increased by over 300 percent in the first eight months of 2019. The consequences of online stalking can be tragic, often leading to physical abuse and even murder. Despite the danger, most of us remain unaware of the risks posed by digital stalking.\r\n\r\nWhat are steps that the average person can take to recognize and protect themselves from a stalker online?\r\n\r\nThis panel will discuss the scale of the problem. David Ruiz, a senior online privacy writer from Malwarebytes, will share the cybersecurity company\u2019s own detection statistics to illustrate recent trends in stalkerware infections. He will also share data from some of the members of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, of which Malwarebytes is a founding partner. They will then discuss the many forms digital stalking can take - from a compromised iCloud account, to surreptitiously installed stalkerware apps, to jailbroken or otherwise compromised phones. The panel will also look into how stalkerware apps differ between iOS and Android. They will also examine state-sponsored stalkerware, like the Saudi-developed Absher app.\r\n\r\nThe talk will present and discuss strategies to defend against stalkers. How can you re-secure your iCloud account? Why should you be wary of \u201cgift\u201d phones and tablets? What are some signs that your device may have stalkerware operating on it? What are free tools that can detect stalkerware? How can you remove stalkerware from your device?\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll learn how victims can protect themselves after they discover a stalker. Panelists will discuss how important it is to secure evidence that a stalker may have left on your device and introduce ways to maintain resilience and redundancy to prevent being locked out of your own phone and online identity. You will learn about organizations - such as the National Network to End Domestic Violence - that can help victims. The speakers will emphasize how critically important it is to have a plan to protect your safety before you take any actions that may alert a stalker.\r\n\r\nFinally, you will learn the answers to these questions: What can be done to advance the fight against online stalking?

Context matters, and the context *is* the content of our lives. Hackers have the tools to identify the fragments of a disintegrating society and use them to model new structures. Hackers have internalized procedures, assumptions, and working models to piece together parts of complex systems to create new wholes, to break down to break through.

Instead of breaking through encryption or utilizing a zero-day exploit, it's often easier to get a password or network access by simply asking for it. It can be done over the phone, via email, or even in an in-person visit. The approach is often highly targeted, designed for a specific individual. This form of social engineering began among the phone phreaks in the 1970s, and by the 2000s, it has become a professionalized practice, complete with a systematized process of gathering OSINT, developing pretexts, engaging, and writing up reports.<br><br>This presentation explores two less-familiar areas of social engineering. First, there will be a look back to a time before the phone phreaks and hackers to another group of people who called themselves social engineers: late 19th and early 20th century social reformers and public relations professionals, specifically Edward Bernays and Doris Fleischman, who developed the \"engineering of consent\" program of using mass media to persuade people to adopt ways of thinking. This earlier form is referred to as mass social engineering, in contrast with the phone phreak and hacker version of interpersonal social engineering. Robert and Sean will look forward beyond the hacker form of interpersonal social engineering to consider a contemporary, emerging mixture of these two forms that are called masspersonal social engineering.<br><br>While the phreaks and hackers often targeted individuals, and the consent engineers targeted masses, masspersonal social engineering is a new form that leverages social media to target individuals on a mass scale. It relies on interpersonal, hacker social engineering techniques, but it has societal-shaping ambitions. A key example of this new form is the Russian election interference campaign of 2016.<br><br>Overall, this presentation places hacker social engineering into a larger historical context and shows how social engineering is a serious matter, not only for organizational security but also for geopolitics.<br><br>", "description": null, "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 146, "code": "PCUVDY", "public_name": "Robert W.

Unfortunately, the technology is already out there - in use - and endangering people's privacy. Due to differing laws, regulations, and data-sharing agreements between federal, state, and local agencies across the country, U.S. residents and visitors frequently have their image not only collected and stored for facial recognition purposes by the government, but often also secretively shared between dozens of agencies. Because of the complexity of these laws and agreements, it's very difficult to learn who exactly has your image. It can take a hacker mindset to learn where your image is - FOIAs, online research, even contacting individuals directly at government agencies. Using all of these methods, EFF developed a new interactive website to explain to users which agencies might be using their image for face recognition - and to spur them to act. The speakers will explain issues with facial recognition technology; what sort of advocacy has been effective in the past; where we stand on federal, state, and local regulations; and discuss how they did the research, design, and creation of the whohasyourface.org website and its result on laws and advocacy, as well as suggest ways that others can build on this research.<br><br>", "description": "", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 227, "code": "SG98YJ", "public_name": "Jason Kelley", "biography": "**Jason Kelley** is a digital strategist at EFF who has assisted in and led various campaigns fighting back against face recognition and surveillance, as well as campaigns promoting privacy.
